Todo:

* we are going to have two different columns
    * first column on the very left will be the time frames (hourly)
    * second column which will take 2/3rds of the page (left to right). This is the entry area.
    * there will need to be a save button (utilizing local storage).



* We will need to color code what hour it is and things like that.
