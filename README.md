Todo:

* we are going to have two different columns
    * first column on the very left will be the time frames (hourly)
    * second column which will take 2/3rds of the page (left to right). This is the entry area.
    * there will need to be a save button (utilizing local storage).



* We will need to color code what hour it is and things like that.
* we would need to create a for loop that looks at how many divs there are or id's.
* Three statements if it's green red or blue.
* tell the function to change the color via css

* We will need to hit the save button and it will save the user input to the local storage.
